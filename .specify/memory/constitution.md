# VibeCRM Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality
All code must be clear, maintainable, and adhere to established project conventions. Code should be self-documenting, with comments reserved for explaining *why*, not *what*.

### II. Testing Standards
Every feature or bug fix must be accompanied by comprehensive tests. This includes unit tests for isolated logic and integration tests for component interactions. A high level of test coverage is required and critical paths must be fully tested.

### III. User Experience (UX) Consistency
The user interface and experience shall be consistent across the entire application. Re-use of components, a consistent design language, and predictable interaction patterns are mandatory to ensure a cohesive and intuitive user journey.

### IV. Performance Requirements
The application must meet defined performance benchmarks. API responses should be timely, and frontend interactions must be smooth and responsive. Performance testing should be part of the development cycle for performance-sensitive features.

### V. Documentation Language
To ensure clarity and accessibility for the target audience, all project documentation outside of the `.specify` directory must be written in Chinese. This includes README files, user guides, and API documentation.

## Governance
All pull requests and code reviews must verify compliance with this constitution. Any deviation from these principles requires explicit justification and approval. This constitution is a living document and can be amended through a formal proposal and review process.
